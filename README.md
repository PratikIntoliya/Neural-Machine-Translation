Neural Machine Translation: 

Overview

This project implements a Neural Machine Translation (NMT) model to translate text from French to English. The model uses a sequence-to-sequence architecture with Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), particularly Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) or Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), enhanced by attention mechanisms. The primary goal is to achieve high-quality translation by training the model on a large bilingual corpus.
